# GameCoin DApp

This project is a decentralized application (DApp) for a strategy game that uses a blockchain-based game currency called Game Coin (GC). The application includes a smart contract implemented in Solidity, and a frontend for user interaction using Web3.js.

## Project Description

In this project, you will create a smart contract and a frontend application to manage game currency on the Ethereum blockchain. The Game Coin (GC) is an ERC-20 token that players can buy, sell, and transfer within the game. The use of blockchain technology ensures that the game's currency system is fair and tamper-proof.

## Features

### Smart Contract (ERC-20)

- **Register User**: Allows users to register with a username, email, and bio.
- **Get User Info**: Retrieve information about a user by their account address.
- **Buy Game Coin (GC)**: Users can buy Game Coin using ETH.
- **Sell Game Coin (GC)**: Users can sell Game Coin to receive ETH.
- **Transfer Game Coin (GC)**: Users can transfer Game Coin to another address.
- **Send to Owner**: Allows the owner to retrieve Game Coin from the contract.
- **Set Rates**: The owner can set the buy and sell rates for Game Coin.

### Frontend

- **Registration and Authorization**: Users can register and authorize using their MetaMask account.
- **Account Information and Balance**: Displays the user's account information and balances.
- **Buy/Sell Game Coin**: Users can buy and sell Game Coin for ETH.
- **Transfer Game Coin**: Users can transfer Game Coin to another address.
- **Sign Out**: Users can sign out from the application.
